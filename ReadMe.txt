Historical Kerbal Suits 1.1.0
A set of custom historical-inspired space suits & props for KSP 1.10.0+ by Benjee10.]

FEATURES
- 7 custom, highly detailed spacesuit types based on real historical spacesuits. Includes ACES (orange & blue variants), Apollo (A7L & A7LB variants), EMU (multiple variants), Sokol (Soyuz) suit, Strizh (Buran) suit, and OCSS (Orion/Artemis) suit. 
- Replaceable IVA suits. Thanks to a custom plugin, SuitCombos are able to override the spacesuits Kerbals wear in IVA.
- Wearable props utilising the stock inventory system (requires KSP 1.11 or later): ACES helmet with adjustable black sun visor; EMU helmet light (attaches to stock suit helmets)

FUTURE PLANS
- Gemini, Mercury, Vostok & xEMU suits & helmets
- TextureReplacer support for pre 1.10 KSP versions

KNOWN ISSUES
- If BlueDog Design Bureau or Tantares are installed, Apollo and Sokol suits (respecitvely) will be duplicated. This can be rectified by removing the 'Suits' folder from the GameData/Tantares/ and GameData/Bluedog_DB/ directories, or alternatively removing the appropriate folder from GameData/Benjee10_Suits/
- Wearable props do not work on versions of KSP pre 1.11.0 due to changes in the stock inventory system. 
- May conflict with other mods that affect the stock Inventory System/Kerbal transforms.
- Custom suit textures will not work correctly with TextureReplacer installed - you will need to untick the 'customise kerbal suits' option in the TextureReplacer settings to fix this. 
- Sun visor on ACES suit helmet is non-transparent. We're working on it.
